# the-first-repository
It Was Number One (for me)

My name is Callie.
<br> 
This is my very first GitHub repository. It's not very special yet, but it's mine!
<br> Looks like I have to manually add in line breaks. Otherwise, even if I use a new line in the edit, it won't show. I think that's an HTML thing?
